 <p>For a while I have practiced drawing the face going feature by feature. However this time I wanted to try something a bit different and do a landscape drawing. I dont think this one came out that well but as they say "If you want to be good at something, first youâ€™ve got to be bad".</p>
<p>Here I drew a tiled path on the beachside at sunset. This came to mind after my trip to Jamaica a couple of months ago.For the path I used a perspective guide to help with the placement which you can see in the second image. Once that part was finished I had to draw the water which was very difficult. To help with this I used shin's guide to water to help with the lightning and placement of aspects. This was the part I spent the most amount of time on. Lastly, I did the sky and the clouds which I also used a guide to get a reference for some cloud shapes. Next time, ill probably practice some shading because I was having some trouble there.</p>
