 <p>I'm Dayne, I'm twenty years old and I like art. Like many kids I liked drawing when I was younger to get away from the boredom of trying to learn my multiplication tables. I would just daydream and scribble on anything in front of me, but as I got older and classes got harder I couldn't just blankly stare at my desk for half the day and thus I stopped drawing.
<br> <br>
 Until one day a very special movie came out, Spiderman: Into the Spider Verse. I saw this movie the day it came out because the visuals alone made me interested in the movie. This movie alone reignited my interest in art immediately. Every aspect of this movie just looked so pretty in my eyes when I walked out the theater the main thought in my head was “I want to make something that looks as cool as that” and so my art journey began.</p>
