 <p>For a while I have practiced drawing the face going feature by feature. However this time I wanted to try something a bit different and do a landscape drawing. I dont think this one came out that well but as they say "If you want to be good at something, first you’ve got to be bad".</p>

 <p>Since watching Spiderverse for the first time in 2018 I have been drawing in spurts trying to improve when I have time. When I first started actually trying to improve my art I would watch tons of videos and take notes. Sadly, these pages and early drawings have been lost so they're probably in a landfill, hidden in a box, or repurposed into someone’s mcDonalds drink holder. </p>

 <p>I'm Dayne, I'm twenty years old and I like art. Like many kids I liked drawing when I was younger to get away from the boredom of trying to learn my multiplication tables. I would just daydream and scribble on anything in front of me, but as I got older and classes got harder I couldn't just blankly stare at my desk for half the day and thus I stopped drawing.</p>
