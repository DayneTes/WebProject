 <p>I'm Dayne, I'm twenty years old and I like art. Like many kids I liked drawing when I was younger to get away from the boredom of trying to learn my multiplication tables. I would just daydream and scribble on anything in front of me, but as I got older and classes got harder I couldn't just blankly stare at my desk for half the day and thus I stopped drawing.
<br> <br>
 Until one day a very special movie came out, Spiderman: Into the Spider Verse. I saw this movie the day it came out because the visuals alone made me interested in the movie. This movie alone reignited my interest in art immediately. Every aspect of this movie just looked so pretty in my eyes when I walked out the theater the main thought in my head was “I want to make something that looks as cool as that” and so my art journey began.</p>

 <p>Since watching Spiderverse for the first time in 2018 I have been drawing in spurts trying to improve when I have time. When I first started actually trying to improve my art I would watch tons of videos and take notes. Sadly, these pages and early drawings have been lost so they're probably in a landfill, hidden in a box, or repurposed into someone’s mcDonalds drink holder. 
 <br><br>

However, throughout the years of me learning and forgetting the stuff in these art lessons there is one that always stuck out to me. “Draw based on what you actually see, not what you think you are looking at.” For example, When people try to draw a tree in front of them the idea of what a tree should look like is going to influence what the end result will be. So by the time they finish it may end up looking like amalgamation of the thousands of trees they have seen in their life instead of the one they are actually trying to draw.
<br><br>

So in my drawing of this person (which I found by searching “dude” in google) I try to break the face features down into different shapes. So instead of drawing the eye in the image I'm just drawing a couple curves and a semicircle. If I have trouble just doing this in my mind I'll trace over certain features with a different color so I can see each distinct shape to make it easier to draw. This is a piece I'm happy to share because I think it looks pretty good compared to other ones I've done and improvement is always nice to see.
